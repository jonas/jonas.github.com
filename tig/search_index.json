text-mode interface for Git\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Tig?\n\n\nTig is an ncurses-based text-mode interface for git. It functions mainly\nas a Git repository browser, but can also assist in staging changes for\ncommit at chunk level and act as a pager for output from various Git\ncommands.\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nHomepage:\thttps://jonas.github.io/tig/\n\n\nManual:\thttps://jonas.github.io/tig/doc/manual.html\n\n\nTarballs:\thttps://github.com/jonas/tig/releases\n\n\nGit URL:\tgit://github.com/jonas/tig.git\n\n\nGitter:\thttps://gitter.im/jonas/tig\n\n\nQ&A:\t\thttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBugs and Feature Requests\n\n\nBugs and feature requests can be reported using the\nissue tracker or by mail to either\nthe Git mailing list or directly to the maintainer. Ensure that the word\n\"tig\" is in the subject. For other Tig related questions please use\nStack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tig.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation and News\n\n\nInformation on how to build and install Tig are found in\nthe installation instructions.\n\n\nNews about releases and latest features and bug fixes are found in\nthe release notes.\n\n\n"},"INSTALL.html":{"url":"INSTALL.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Installation instructions\n\n\n\nDownload a tarball from https://github.com/jonas/tig/releases or clone the Tig\nrepository git://github.com/jonas/tig.git.\n\n\nThe latest version is:\ntig-2.5.4\n(sha256)\n\n\nNote: Do not use the tar.gz file for version 2.0 because it will fail\nto compile due to issue #283 and\n#337\n\n\nThe quick and simple way to install Tig is:\n\n\n\n$ make\n$ make install\n\n\n\nBy default, tig is installed in $HOME/bin. To install tig elsewhere set\nprefix to the desired path:\n\n\n\n$ make prefix=/usr/local\n$ sudo make install prefix=/usr/local\n\n\n\nAdditional build options can be defined in the config.make file, which is\nloaded automatically when running make if it exists. By default,\ncontrib/config.make-$kernel_name is loaded if it exists (currently\navailable for Linux, macOS [Darwin] and Cygwin but Linux users should\nprefer the configure script). See contrib/config.make for example build\noptions.\n\n\nDocumentation files, such as manpages, are distributed in the release tarballs,\nand can be installed using:\n\n\n\n$ make install-doc\n\n\n\nWhen installing directly from the Tig repository, make install-doc will assume\nthat the documentation tool chain is available and build the documentation\nlocally. In case you do not wish to install the required tools, documentation\ncan be installed from the release branch using:\n\n\n\n$ make install-release-doc\n\n\n\nBefore upgrading, you are advised to read the release notes.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation using configure\n\n\nIf you prefer an autotools-based installation process, you can use the\nconfigure script to detect dependencies and enable features. If you downloaded\nthe Tig sources from a release tarball\nthere’s already a configure script. However, if you are building from the Tig\nrepository, you need to ensure that autoconf is installed on your system and\ngenerate the configure script yourself.\n\n\nTo install using configure, run the following commands:\n\n\n\n$ make configure # Only run if you are building from the Git repository\n$ ./configure\n$ make\n$ make install\n\n\n\nIf your iconv library is not in the default library and include path, you need\nto pass the --with-libiconv option to configure to tell it where to look.\n\n\nIf you have installed ncurses with brew, run configure with the following\nflags to have it properly detected (note this done out of the box if you\nbuild without configure):\n\n\n\n$ ./configure LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/ncurses/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/ncurses/include\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation using Homebrew\n\n\nYou can use Homebrew to install Tig on OS X:\n\n\n\n$ brew install tig\n\n\n\nNote, for older installations of Tig, Homebrew does not automatically\nupdate the system-wide tigrc file when upgrading Tig and the\nbehavior\nwas changed in 2015 to install the system-wide tigrc in the\n/usr/local/share/tig/examples directory so Tig always uses the\ndefaults compiled into the binary.\n\n\nIf you see warnings when starting Tig after upgrading, e.g.:\n\n\n\ntig warning: Errors while loading /usr/local/etc/tigrc\n\n\n\nIt means you either need to manually update /usr/local/etc/tigrc with\nchanges from /usr/local/share/tig/examples rename the file if you\nnever made any changes to it.\n\n\n\n$ mv /usr/local/etc/tigrc{,.old}\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation using Nix\n\n\nYou can use Nix to install Tig on NixOS, or any Linux/macOS distribution with Nix installed:\n\n\n\n$ nix-env -i tig\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation on FreeBSD\n\n\nYou can use pkg to install Tig on FreeBSD:\n\n\n\n$ pkg install tig\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation on Windows\n\n\nEasiest way is to install Git-for-Windows. As\nof version 2.14.2, it comes bundled with tig.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can also use it by installing cygwin.\nYou must then install the packages git, gcc-core, make, libiconv-devel\nand libncurses-devel. Extract the tarball and install by using configure\nas explained above.\n\n\nIf you want to install from the sources, then you will also need the automake\npackage (which will also install autoconf). Then run make configure and install\nby using configure as explained above.\n\n\n\n\nBuild configuration\n\n\nBuild settings are read from the file config.make and for certain systems also\nfrom contrib/config.make-$kernel. An example of the latter is macOS, where\ncontrib/config.make-Darwin provides out-of-the-box configuration for using the\nsystem ncurses library and linking with the iconv library. This makes it easy to\nconfigure the build without having to use the configure script. As a side\nnote, configure itself generates a config.make file.\n\n\nApart from the different standard make build variables (CC, CFLAGS, etc.)\nand standard configure variables (prefix, bindir, etc.), build settings\ncan be one of the following flags:\n\n\n\n\nNO_SETENV: Define this variable to enable work-around for missing\nsetenv().\n\n\nNO_MKSTEMPS: Define this variable to enable work-around for missing\nmkstemps().\n\n\nNO_WORDEXP: Define this variable to enable work-around for missing\nwordexp().\n\n\nNO_BUILTIN_TIGRC: Reduce the size of the binary by not including a\nbuilt-in tigrc. The built-in tigrc is used as a fallback when no\ntigrc is found in the system configuration directory (e.g. /etc).\n\n\nTIG_USER_CONFIG: Allow to customize the tigrc path (default ~/.tigrc).\n\n\n\n\nThe following example config.make manually configures Tig to use the ncurses\nlibrary with wide character support and include the proper ncurses header file\n(see tig.h for more information):\n\n\n\nLDLIBS = -lncursesw\nCPPFLAGS = -DHAVE_NCURSESW_CURSES_H\n\n\n\nFor more examples of build settings, see contrib/config.make and\nconfig.make.in.\n\n\n\n\nTools and packages\n\n\nThe following tools and packages are needed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTool\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngit-core\nTig is just a frontend for Git.\n\n\nncurses or ncursesw\nBe sure to have the development files\n\t\t\t\t installed. Usually they are available in a\n\t\t\t\t separate package ending with -dev.\n\t\t\t\t Ncurses with wide character support (ncursesw)\n\t\t\t\t is required to properly handle UTF-8 encoded\n\t\t\t\t strings.\n\t\t\t\t Note for packagers: For Tig’s configure\n\t\t\t\t script to work as expected you should avoid\n\t\t\t\t configuring and building ncurses using\n\t\t\t\t --with-shared.\n\n\niconv\nIf iconv is not provided by the c library\n\t\t\t\t you need to change the Makefile to link it\n\t\t\t\t into the binary.\n\n\n\n\nThe following tools and packages are optional and mainly needed for creating the\nconfigure script and building documentation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTool\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nreadline\nAdds support for completion and history in\n\t\t\t\t search and command prompts.\n\n\nautoconf\nContains autoreconf for generating configure\n\t\t\t\t from configure.ac.\n\n\nasciidoc (>= 8.4)\nGenerates HTML and (DocBook) XML from text.\n\n\nxmlto\nGenerates manpages and chunked HTML from XML.\n\n\nDocBook XSL (>= 1.72.0)\nUsed by xmlto for building manpages.\n\n\nDocBook (DSSL/Jade) tools\nGenerates PDF from XML.\n\t\t\t\t Also known as docbook-utils.\n\n\n\n\n"},"NEWS.html":{"url":"NEWS.html","title":"Release notes","keywords":"","body":"Release notes\n\ntig-2.5.4\n\n\nImprovements:\n\n\n\n\nAdd FreeBSD installation instructions.

It functions\nmainly as a Git repository browser, but can also assist in staging\nchanges for commit at chunk level and act as a pager for output from\nvarious Git commands.\n\n\n\n\nOPTIONS\n\n\nCommand line options recognized by Tig include all valid git-log(1) and\ngit-diff(1) options, as well as the following subcommands and Tig-specific\noptions. The first command line parameter not starting with \"-\" is interpreted\nas being either a revision specification or a path and will end the option\nparsing. All additional options will be passed to the underlying Git command.\n\n\n\nshow\n\nOpen diff view using the given git-show(1) options.\n\nblame\n\nShow given file annotated by commits.\nTakes zero or more git-blame(1) options.\nOptionally limited from given revision.\n\nstatus\n\nStart up in status view.\n\nlog\n\nStart up in log view, displaying git-log(1) output.\n\nreflog\n\nStart up in reflog view.\n\nrefs\n\nStart up in refs view.\n\nstash\n\nStart up in stash view.\n\ngrep\n\nOpen the grep view. Supports the same options as git-grep(1).\n\n+\n\nShow the first view with line  visible and selected.\n\n-v, --version\n\nShow version and exit.\n\n-h, --help\n\nShow help message and exit.\n\n-C \n\nRun as if Tig was started in  instead of the current working directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPAGER MODE\n\n\nTig enters pager mode when input is provided via stdin and supports the\nfollowing subcommands and options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the show subcommand is specified and the --stdin option is given,\nstdin is assumed to be a list of commit IDs and will be forwarded to the diff\nview’s underlying git-show(1) command. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n$ git rev-list --author=vivien HEAD | tig show --stdin\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen --stdin is given, stdin is assumed to be a list of commit IDs\nand will be forwarded to the main view’s underlying git-log(1)\ncommand. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n$ tig --no-walk --stdin \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen --pretty=raw is given, stdin is assumed to be a \"pretty=raw\"\nformatted output similar to that of git-log(1). For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n$ git reflog --pretty=raw | tig --pretty=raw\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen no subcommands nor options are given, the pager view will be used for\ndisplaying the Git command input given on stdin. The pager view assumes the\ninput is either from git-log(1) or git-diff(1) and will highlight it similar to\nthe log and diff views. For example:\n\n\n\n$ git log -Schange -p --raw | tig\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nDisplay the list of commits for the current branch:\n\n\n\n$ tig\n\n\n\nDisplay commits from one or more branches:\n\n\n\n$ tig test master\n\n\n\nPretend as if all the refs in refs/ are listed on the command line:\n\n\n\n$ tig --all\n\n\n\nDisplay differences between two branches:\n\n\n\n$ tig test..master\n\n\n\nDisplay changes for sub-module versions:\n\n\n\n$ tig --submodule\n\n\n\nDisplay changes for a single file:\n\n\n\n$ tig -- README\n\n\n\nDisplay contents of the README file in a specific revision:\n\n\n\n$ tig show tig-0.8:README\n\n\n\nDisplay revisions between two dates for a specific file:\n\n\n\n$ tig --after=\"2004-01-01\" --before=\"2006-05-16\" -- README\n\n\n\nBlame file with copy detection enabled:\n\n\n\n$ tig blame -C README\n\n\n\nDisplay the list of stashes:\n\n\n\n$ tig stash\n\n\n\nGrep all files for lines containing DEFINE_ENUM:\n\n\n\n$ tig grep -p DEFINE_ENUM\n\n\n\nShow references (branches, remotes and tags):\n\n\n\n$ tig refs\n\n\n\nUse word diff in the diff view:\n\n\n\n$ tig --word-diff=plain\n\n\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\n\n\nIn addition to environment variables used by Git (e.g. GIT_DIR), Tig defines\nthe ones below. The command related environment variables have access to the\ninternal state of Tig via replacement variables, such as %(commit) and\n%(blob).\nSee tigrc(5) for a full list.\n\n\n\nTIGRC_USER\n\nPath of the user configuration file (defaults to ~/.tigrc or\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tig/config).\n\nTIGRC_SYSTEM\n\nPath of the system wide configuration file (defaults to\n{sysconfdir}/tigrc). Define to empty string to use built-in\nconfiguration.\n\nTIG_LS_REMOTE\n\nCommand for retrieving all repository references. The command\nshould output data in the same format as git-ls-remote(1).\n\nTIG_DIFF_OPTS\n\nThe diff options to use in the diff view. The diff view uses\ngit-show(1) for formatting and always passes --patch-with-stat.  You\nmay also set the diff-options setting in the configuration file.\n\nTIG_TRACE\n\nPath for trace file where information about Git commands are logged.\n\nTIG_SCRIPT\n\nPath to script that should be executed automatically on startup. If this\nenvironment variable is defined to the empty string, the script is read\nfrom stdin. The script is interpreted line-by-line and can contain\nprompt commands and key mappings.\n\n\nE.g. TIG_SCRIPT=\n\n\n\nTIG_NO_DISPLAY\n\nOpen Tig without rendering anything to the terminal. This force Ncurses\nto write to /dev/null. The main use is for automated testing of Tig.\n\nTIG_EDITOR\n\nThe editor command to use when visiting files. This environment\nvariable overrides $GIT_EDITOR, $EDITOR and $VISUAL, so it allows\nto use a different editor from the one Git uses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFILES\n\n\n\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tig/config\n~/.config/tig/config\n~/.tigrc\n\nThe Tig user configuration file is loaded in the following way. If\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set, read user configuration from\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tig/config. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is empty or\nundefined, read user configuration from ~/.config/tig/config if it\nexists and fall back to ~/.tigrc if it does not exist. See\nmanpage:tigrc[5] for examples.\n\n/etc/tigrc\n\nSystem wide configuration file.\n\n$GIT_DIR/config\n~/.gitconfig\n/etc/gitconfig\n\nGit configuration files. Read on start-up with the help of\ngit-config(1).\n\n$XDG_DATA_HOME/tig/history\n~/.local/share/tig/history\n~/.tig_history\n\nWhen compiled with readline support, Tig writes a persistent command and\nsearch history. The location of the history file is determined in the\nfollowing way. If $XDG_DATA_HOME is set and $XDG_DATA_HOME/tig/\nexists, store history to $XDG_DATA_HOME/tig/history. If\n$XDG_DATA_HOME is empty or undefined, store history to\n~/.local/share/tig/history if the directory ~/.local/share/tig/\nexists, and fall back to ~/.tig_history if it does not exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUGS\n\n\nPlease visit Tig’s home page or\nmain Git repository for information about\nnew releases and how to report bugs or feature request.\n\n\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2006-2014 Jonas Fonseca jonas.fonseca@gmail.com>\n\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\n\n\n\nSEE ALSO\n\n\ntigrc(5),\nthe Tig manual,\ngit(7)\n\n\n"},"doc/tigrc.5.html":{"url":"doc/tigrc.5.html","title":"tigrc(5)","keywords":"","body":"tigrc(5)\n\nNAME\n\n\ntigrc - Tig configuration file\n\n\n\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\n\nset   variable = value\nbind  keymap key action\ncolor area fgcolor bgcolor [attributes]\nsource path\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\nYou can permanently set an option by putting it in the ~/.tigrc file.  The\nfile consists of a series of commands.  Each line of the file may contain\nonly one command.  Commands can span multiple lines if each line is\nterminated by a backslash (\\) character.\n\n\nThe hash mark (#) is used as a comment character. All text after the\ncomment character to the end of the line is ignored. You can use comments to\nannotate your initialization file.\n\n\nCertain options can be manipulated at runtime via the option menu. In\naddition, options can also be toggled with the :toggle prompt command\nor by entering the configuration command into the prompt.\n\n\nIn some environments, a user’s configuration will be stored in the alternate\nlocation $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tig/config.  For brevity, this document will\nrefer only to ~/.tigrc.\n\n\n\n\nGit configuration\n\n\nAlternatively to using ~/.tigrc, Tig options can be set by putting them in\none of the Git configuration files, which are read by Tig on startup. See\ngit-config(1) for which files to use. The following example show the basic\nsyntax to use for settings, bindings and colors.\n\n\n\n[tig] show-changes = true\n[tig \"color\"] cursor = yellow red bold\n[tig \"bind\"] generic = P parent\n\n\n\nIn addition to tig-specific options, the following Git options are read from\nthe Git configuration:\n\n\n\ncolor.*\n\nColors for the various UI types. Can be configured via the git-colors\nsetting.\n\ncore.abbrev\n\nThe width of the commit ID. See also id-width option.\n\ncore.editor\n\nThe editor command. Can be overridden by setting TIG_EDITOR or\nGIT_EDITOR.\n\ncore.worktree\n\nThe path to the root of the working tree.\n\ngui.encoding\n\nThe encoding to use for displaying of file content.\n\ni18n.commitencoding\n\nThe encoding used for commits. The default is UTF-8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet command\n\n\nA few selective variables can be configured via the set command. The syntax\nis:\n\n\nset variables = value\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nset commit-order = topo\t\t# Order commits topologically\nset git-colors = no\t\t# Do not read Git's color settings.\nset horizontal-scroll = 33%\t# Scroll 33% of the view width\nset blame-options = -C -C -C\t# Blame lines from other files\n\n# Wrap branch names with () and tags with <>\nset reference-format = (branch) \n\n# Configure blame view columns using command spanning multiple lines.\nset blame-view = \\\n\tdate:default \\\n\tauthor:abbreviated \\\n\tfile-name:auto \\\n\tid:yes,color \\\n\tline-number:yes,interval=5 text\n\n\n\nOr in the Git configuration files:\n\n\n\n[tig]\n\tline-graphics = no\t# Disable graphics characters\n\ttab-size = 8\t\t# Number of spaces per tab\n\n\n\nThe type of variables is either bool, int, string, or mixed.\n\n\n\nValid bool values\n\nTo set a bool variable to true use either \"1\", \"true\", or \"yes\".\nAny other value will set the variable to false.\n\nValid int values\n\nA non-negative integer.\n\nValid string values\n\nA string of characters. Optionally, use either ' or \" as delimiters.\n\nValid mixed values\n\nThese values are composites of the above types. The valid values are\nspecified in the description.\n\n\n\n\nVariables\n\nThe following variables can be set:\n\n\n\ndiff-options (string)\n\nA space-separated string of diff options to use in the diff view.\ngit-show(1) is used for formatting and always passes --patch-with-stat.\nCan control display of commit header metadata, passing option --format.\nThis option overrides any options specified in the TIG_DIFF_OPTS\nenvironment variable (described in manpage:tig[1]), but is itself\noverridden by diff flags given on the command line invocation.\n\nblame-options (string)\n\nA space-separated string of default blame options. Can be used for\ntelling git-blame(1) how to detect the origin of lines. The options\nare ignored when Tig is started in blame mode and given blame options\non the command line.\n\nlog-options (string)\n\nA space-separated string of default options that should be passed to the\ngit-log(1) command used by the log view. Options can be overridden by\ncommand line options. Used internally override custom ‘pretty.format’\nsettings that break the log view.\n\nmain-options (string)\n\nA space-separated string of default options that should be passed to the\ngit-log(1) command used by the main view. Options can be overridden by\ncommand line options.\n\nreference-format (string)\n\nA space-separated string of format strings used for formatting reference\nnames. Wrap the name of the reference type with the characters you would\nlike to use for formatting, e.g. [tag] and . If no format is\nspecified for local-tag, the format for tag is used. Similarly, if no\nformat is specified for tracked-remote the remote format is used.\nPrefix with hide: to not show that reference type, e.g. hide:remote.\nSupported reference types are:\n\n\n\nhead\t\t\t: The current HEAD.\n\n\ntag\t\t\t: A signed tag.\n\n\nlocal-tag\t\t: An unsigned tag.\n\n\nremote\t\t: A remote.\n\n\ntracked-remote\t: The remote tracked by current HEAD.\n\n\nreplace\t\t: A replaced reference.\n\n\nbranch\t\t: Any other reference.\n\n\n\n\nline-graphics (mixed) [ascii|default|utf-8|auto|]\n\nWhat type of character graphics for line drawing. \"auto\" means \"utf-8\"\nif the locale is UTF-8, \"default\" otherwise.\n\ntruncation-delimiter (mixed) [utf-8|]\n\nA single character to draw where columns are truncated. The default is\n\"~\".  The special value \"utf-8\" refers to the character \"⋯\"\n(\"Midline Horizontal Ellipsis\").\n\nhorizontal-scroll (mixed)\n\nInterval to scroll horizontally in each step. Can be specified either\nas the number of columns, e.g. 5, or as a percentage of the view\nwidth, e.g. 33%, where the maximum is 100%. For percentages it is\nalways ensured that at least one column is scrolled. The default is to\nscroll 50% of the view width.\n\ngit-colors (list)\n\nA space-separated list of \"key=value\" pairs where the key is a Git color\nname and the value is a Tig color name, e.g. \"branch.current=main-head\"\nand \"grep.filename=grep.file\". Set to \"no\" to disable.\n\nshow-notes (mixed) [|]\n\nWhether to show notes for a commit. When set to a note reference the\nreference is passed to git show --notes=. Notes are enabled by\ndefault.\n\nshow-changes (bool)\n\nWhether to show staged and unstaged changes in the main view.\n\nshow-untracked (bool)\n\nWhether to show also untracked changes in the main view.\n\nvertical-split (mixed) [auto|]\n\nWhether to split the view horizontally or vertically.\n\"auto\" (which is the default) means that it will depend on the window\ndimensions. When true vertical orientation is used, and false sets the\norientation to horizontal.\n\nsplit-view-height (mixed)\n\nThe height of the bottom view in a horizontally split display. Can be\nspecified either as the number of rows, e.g. 5, or as a percentage of\nthe view height, e.g. 80%, where the maximum is 100%. It is always\nensured that the smaller of the views is at least four rows high. The\ndefault is 67%.\n\nsplit-view-width (mixed)\n\nWidth of the right-most view in a vertically split display. Can be\nspecified either as the number of column, e.g. 5, or as a percentage\nof the view width, e.g. 80%, where the maximum is 100%. It is always\nensured that the smaller of the views is at least four columns wide. The\ndefault is 50%.\n\nstatus-show-untracked-dirs (bool)\n\nShow untracked directories contents in the status view (analog to\ngit ls-files --directory option). On by default.\n\nstatus-show-untracked-files (bool)\n\nShow untracked files in the status view (mirrors Git’s\nstatus.showUntrackedFiles option). On by default.\n\ntab-size (int)\n\nNumber of spaces per tab. The default is 8 spaces.\n\ndiff-context (int)\n\nNumber of context lines to show for diffs.\n\ndiff-highlight (mixed)\n\nWhether to highlight diffs using Git’s diff-highlight program. Defaults\nto false. When set to true then diff-highlight is used, else the option\nvalue is used as the path. When this option is in effect, highlighted\nregions are governed by color diff-add-highlight and\ncolor diff-del-highlight.\n\nignore-space (mixed) [no|all|some|at-eol|]\n\nIgnore space changes in diff view. By default no space changes are\nignored. Changing this to \"all\", \"some\" or \"at-eol\" is equivalent to\npassing \"--ignore-all-space\", \"--ignore-space\" or\n\"--ignore-space-at-eol\" respectively to git diff or git show.\n\nWarning: when ignore-space is set to some, all or at-eol, then\nthe status-update and status-revert may fail when updating or\nreverting chunks containing lines with space changes. Similarly,\nstage-update-line may fail when updating a line adjacent to a line\nwith space changes\n\ncommit-order (enum) [auto|default|topo|date|author-date|reverse]\n\nCommit ordering using the default (chronological reverse) order,\ntopological order, date order or reverse order. When set to \"auto\"\n(which is the default), topological order is automatically used in the\nmain view when the commit graph is enabled. In repositories with a long\ncommit history it is advised to set this option to \"default\" to speed up\nloading of the main view.\n\nignore-case (enum) [no|yes|smart-case]\n\nIgnore case in searches. \"smart-case\" ignores case if the search string\ndoesn’t contain any uppercase letters. By default, the search is case\nsensitive.\n\nmailmap (bool)\n\nRead canonical name and email addresses for authors and committers from\n.mailmap. Off by default. See git-shortlog(1).\n\nwrap-lines (bool)\n\nWrap long lines. By default, lines are not wrapped.\nNot compatible with line numbers enabled.\n\nfocus-child (bool)\n\nWhether to focus the child view when it is opened. When disabled the\nfocus will remain in the parent view, avoiding reloads of the child\nview when navigating the parent view. True by default.\n\nsend-child-enter (bool)\n\nWhether to send \"enter\" key presses to the child view, even if parent\nview is active. When disabled the child view has to be explicitly\nfocused to receive the \"enter\" key presses. In practice only relevant\nwhen set focus-child = no. True by default.\n\neditor-line-number (bool)\n\nWhether to pass the selected line number to the editor command. The\nline number is passed as + in front of the file name.\nExample: vim +10 tig.c\n\nhistory-size (int)\n\nSize of the persistent ~/.tig_history file when compiled with readline\nsupport. Default is 500. Set to 0 to disable.\n\nmouse (bool)\n\nWhether to enable mouse support. Off by default since it makes selecting\ntext from the terminal less intuitive. When enabled hold down Shift (or\nOption on Mac) to select text. Mouse support requires that ncurses\nitself support mouse events.\n\nmouse-scroll (int)\n\nInterval to scroll up or down using the mouse. The default is 3 lines.\nMouse support requires that ncurses itself support mouse events and that\nyou have enabled mouse support in ~/.tigrc with set mouse = true.\n\nmouse-wheel-cursor (bool)\n\nWhether to prefer moving the cursor to scrolling the view when using the\nmouse wheel. Off by default. Combines well with set mouse-scroll = 1.\nMouse support requires that ncurses itself support mouse events and that\nyou have enabled mouse support in ~/.tigrc with set mouse = true.\n\npgrp (bool)\n\nMake tig process-group leader when starting and clean all processes\nwhen exiting. Off by default. Do not enable this option if you are\nusing a Zsh version affected by zsh-workers/43379. Run xclip with\nsetsid to keep clipboard content after exiting tig. If you are using\ngit-credential-cache helper, set option credentialCache.ignoreSIGHUP.\n\nstart-on-head (bool)\n\nStart with cursor on HEAD commit.\n\nrefresh-mode (mixed) [manual|auto|after-command|periodic|]\n\nConfigures how views are refreshed based on modifications to watched\nfiles in the repository. When set to manual, nothing is refreshed\nautomatically. When set to auto, views are refreshed when a\nmodification is detected in another view. When set to after-command\nonly refresh after returning from an external command. When set to\nperiodic, visible views are refreshed periodically using\nrefresh-interval.\n\nrefresh-interval (int)\n\nInterval in seconds between view refresh update checks when\nrefresh-mode is set to periodic.\n\nfile-args (args)\n\nCommand line arguments referring to files. These are filtered using\ngit-rev-parse(1).\n\nrev-args (args)\n\nCommand line arguments referring to revisions. These are filtered using\ngit-rev-parse(1).\n\n\n\n\n\nView settings\n\nThe view settings define the order and options for the different columns of a\nview. Each view setting expects a space-separated list of column specifications.\nColumn specifications starts with the column type, and can optionally be\nfollowed by a colon (:) and a list of column options. E.g. the following\ncolumn specification defines an author column displaying the author email and\nwith a fixed width of 20 characters: author:email,width=20.\n\n\nThe first option value in a column specification is always the display option.\nWhen no display value is given, yes is assumed. For display options\nexpecting an enumerated value this will automatically resolve to the default\nenum value. For example, file-name will automatically have its display\nsetting resolve to auto.\n\n\nSpecifications can also be given for a single column, for example to override\nthe defaults in the system tigrc file. To override a single column, use the\ncolumn name as a suffix after the view setting name, e.g. main-view-date will\nallow to set the date in the main view.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n# Enable both ID and line numbers in the blame view\nset blame-view = date:default author:full file-name:auto id:yes,color \\\n\t\t line-number:yes,interval=5 text\n\n# Change grep view to be similar to `git grep` format\nset grep-view = file-name:yes line-number:yes,interval=1 text\n\n# Show file sizes as units\nset tree-view = line-number:no,interval=5 mode author:full \\\n\t\tfile-size:units date:default id:no file-name\n\n# Show line numbers for every 10th line in the pager view\nset pager-view = line-number:yes,interval=10 text\n\n# Shorthands to change view settings for a previously defined column\nset main-view-date = custom\nset main-view-date-format = \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\"\nset blame-view-line-number = no\n# Use Git's default commit order, even when the commit graph is enabled.\nset commit-order = default\n\n\n\nThe following list shows which the available view settings and what column types\nthey support:\n\n\n\nblob-view, diff-view, log-view, pager-view, stage-view\n\nline-number, text\n\nblame-view\n\nauthor, date, file-name, id, line-number, text\n\ngrep-view\n\nfile-name, line-number, text\n\nmain-view, reflog-view\n\nauthor, date, commit-title, id, line-number, ref\n\nrefs-view\n\nauthor, date, commit-title, id, line-number, ref\n\nstash-view\n\nauthor, date, commit-title, id, line-number\n\nstatus-view\n\nfile-name, line-number, status\n\ntree-view\n\nauthor, date, id, file-name, file-size, line-number, mode\n\n\n\n\nSupported column types and their respective column options:\n\n\n\nauthor\n\n\n\n\ndisplay (mixed) [full|abbreviated|email|email-user|]: How to\ndisplay author names. If set to \"abbreviated\" author initials will be\nshown.\n\n\nwidth (int): Fixed width for the column. When set to a value between\n1 and 10, the author name will be abbreviated to the author’s initials.\nWhen set to zero, the width is automatically sized to fit the content.\n\n\nmaxwidth (int): Maximum width of the column. Permit automatically\nsizing content, up to this limit. Can be specified either as the number\nof columns, e.g. 15, or as a percentage of the view width, e.g. 20%,\nwhere the maximum is 100%.\n\n\n\n\ncommit-title\n\n\n\n\ngraph (mixed) [no|v2|v1]: Whether to show the revision graph in the\nmain view on start-up. \"v1\" refers to the old graph rendering, which\nis less accurate but faster and thus recommended in large\nrepositories.  See also the line-graphics options.\n\n\nrefs (bool): Whether to show references (branches, tags, and\nremotes) in the main view. Can be toggled.\n\n\noverflow (bool or int): Whether to highlight text in commit titles\nexceeding a given width. When set to a boolean, it enables or disables\nthe highlighting using the default width of 50 character. When set to\nan int, the assigned value is used as the maximum character width.\n\n\n\n\ndate\n\n\n\n\ndisplay (mixed) [relative|relative-compact|custom|default|]:\nHow to display dates. If set to \"relative\" or \"relative-compact\" a\nrelative date will be used, e.g. \"2 minutes ago\" or \"2m\". If set to\n\"custom\", the strftime(3) string format specified in the \"format\"\noption is used.\n\n\nlocal (bool): If true, use localtime(3) to convert to local\ntimezone. Note that relative dates always use local offsets.\n\n\nformat (string): format string to pass to strftime(3) when custom\ndisplay mode has been selected.\n\n\nwidth (int): Fixed width for the column. When set to zero, the width\nis automatically sized to fit the content.\n\n\n\n\nfile-name\n\n\n\n\ndisplay (mixed) [auto|always|]: When to display file names.\nIf set to \"auto\" file names are shown only when needed, e.g. when\nrunning: tig blame -C .\n\n\nwidth (int): Width of the column. When set to zero, the width is\nautomatically sized to fit the content.\n\n\nmaxwidth (int): Maximum width of the column. Permit automatically\nsizing content, up to this limit. Can be specified either as the number\nof columns, e.g. 15, or as a percentage of the view width, e.g. 20%,\nwhere the maximum is 100%.\n\n\n\n\nfile-size\n\n\n\n\ndisplay (mixed) [default|units|]: How to display file sizes.\nWhen set to \"units\", sizes are shown using binary prefixes, e.g. 12524\nbytes is shown as \"12.2K\".\n\n\nwidth (int): Fixed width for the filename column. When set to zero,\nthe width is automatically sized to fit the content.\n\n\n\n\nid\n\n\n\n\ndisplay (bool): Whether to show commit IDs in the main view.\n\n\nwidth (int) : Fixed width for the commit ID column. When unset Tig\nwill use the value of core.abbrev if found. See git-config(1) on how\nto set core.abbrev. When set to zero the width is automatically sized\nto fit the content of reflog (e.g.  ref/stash@{4}) IDs and otherwise\ndefault to 7.\n\n\n\n\nline-number\n\n\n\n\ndisplay (bool): Whether to show line numbers.\n\n\ninterval (int): Interval between line numbers.\n\n\nwidth (int): Fixed width for the column. When set to zero, the width\nis automatically sized to fit the content.\n\n\n\n\nmode\n\n\n\n\ndisplay (bool): Whether to show file modes.\n\n\nwidth (int): Fixed width for the column. When set to zero, the width\nis automatically sized to fit the content.\n\n\n\n\nref\n\n\n\n\ndisplay (bool): Whether to show the reference name.\n\n\nwidth (int): Fixed width for the column. When set to zero, the width\nis automatically sized to fit the content.\n\n\nmaxwidth (int): Maximum width of the column. Permit automatically\nsizing content, up to this limit. Can be specified either as the number\nof columns, e.g. 15, or as a percentage of the view width, e.g. 20%,\nwhere the maximum is 100%.\n\n\n\n\nstatus\n\n\n\n\ndisplay (mixed) [no|short|long|]: How to display the status\nlabel.\n\n\n\n\ntext\n\n\n\n\ncommit-title-overflow (bool or int): Whether to highlight commit\ntitles exceeding a given width in the diff view. When set to a\nboolean, it enables or disables the highlighting using the default\nwidth of 50 character. When set to an int, the assigned value is used\nas the maximum character width.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll column options can be toggled. For display options, use the\noption name as the prefix followed by a dash and the column name. E.g.\n:toggle author-display will toggle the display option in the author\ncolumn. For all other options use the column name followed by a dash and\nthen the option name as the suffix. E.g. :toggle commit-title-graph\nwill toggle the graph option in the commit-title column. Alternatively,\nuse the option menu to manipulate options.\n\n\n\n\n\nBind command\n\n\nUsing bind commands, keys can be mapped to an action when pressed in a given\nkey map. The syntax is:\n\n\nbind keymap key action\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n# Add keybinding to quickly jump to the next diff chunk in the stage view\nbind stage  :/^@@\n\n# Disable the default mapping for running git-gc\nbind generic G none\n\n# User-defined external command to amend the last commit\nbind status + !git commit --amend\n\n# User-defined internal command that reloads ~/.tigrc\nbind generic S :source ~/.tigrc\n\n# UTF8-encoded characters can be used as key values.\nbind generic ø @sh -c \"printf '%s' %(commit) | pbcopy\"\n\n\n\nOr in the Git configuration files:\n\n\n\n[tig \"bind\"]\n\t# 'unbind' the default quit key binding\n\tmain = Q none\n\t# Cherry-pick current commit onto current branch\n\tgeneric = C !git cherry-pick %(commit)\n\n\n\nKeys are mapped by first searching the keybindings for the current view, then\nthe keybindings for the generic keymap, and last the default keybindings.\nThus, the view keybindings override the generic keybindings which override the\nbuilt-in keybindings.\n\n\nKeybindings at the line-entry prompt are typically governed by the readline\nlibrary, and are configured separately in ~/.inputrc.  See readline(1).\nTig respects but does not require an $if tig section in ~/.inputrc.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeymaps\n\nValid keymaps are: main, diff, log, reflog, help, pager, status,\nstage, tree, blob, blame, refs, stash, grep and generic. Use\ngeneric to set key mapping in all keymaps. Use search to define keys for\nnavigating search results during search.\n\nKey values\n\nKey values should never be quoted. Use either an ASCII or UTF8-encoded character\nor one of the following symbolic key names. Symbolic key names are case\ninsensitive and starts with \"\". Use  to bind to the\n# key, since the hash mark is used as a comment character. Use  to\nbind to the  key.\n\n\n\n\n, , , ,  or , ,\n, , ,  or ,  or ,\n,  or , , ,  or ,\n or ,  or ,  or\n,  or , , ,\n or , , , ,\n,  …​ \n\n\nTo define key mappings with the Ctrl key, use . In addition, key\ncombos consisting of an initial Escape key followed by a normal key value can\nbe bound using key.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nbind main R\t\trefresh\nbind main \tnext\nbind main \tscroll-page-down\nbind main o\toptions\nbind main \tparent\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nTig reads keystrokes via ncurses and is subject to various limitations. See\nncurses(3x) and terminfo(5) (or termcap).\n\n\nCtrl-m and Ctrl-i cannot be bound as they conflict with Enter and Tab\nrespectively.\n\n\nCase differences cannot be distinguished in control sequences such as\nCtrl-f and Ctrl-F.\n\n\nCtrl- is typically translated to Ctrl-@, which is available for\nbinding.\n\n\nOnly some subset of special symbolic keys such as  will be\navailable in any given terminal emulator.\n\n\nCtrl-z is automatically used for process control and will suspend Tig and\nopen a subshell (use fg to reenter Tig).\n\n\nActions\n\nActions are either specified as user-defined commands (external or internal) or\nusing action names as described in the following sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal user-defined command\n\nThese actions start with one or more of the following option flags followed by\nthe command that should be executed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n!\nRun the command in the foreground with output shown.\n\n\n@\nRun the command in the background with no output.\n\n\n+\nRun the command synchronously, and echo the first line\n\t\t\t of output to the status bar.\n\n\n?\nPrompt the user before executing the command.\n\n\n\nExit Tig after executing the command.\n\n\n>\nRe-open Tig instantly in the last displayed view after\n\t\t\t executing the command.\n\n\n\n\nUnless otherwise specified, commands are run in the foreground with their\nconsole output shown (as if ! was specified). When multiple command options\nare specified their behavior are combined, e.g. \"?\n\n\nNote that if you want to use pipes or redirection in your commands then you\nmust run them in a subshell, i.e. embed your commands in sh -c ''.\n\n\nBrowsing state variables\n\nUser-defined commands can optionally refer to Tig’s internal state using the\nfollowing variable names, which are substituted before commands are run:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%(head)\nThe currently viewed head ID. Defaults to HEAD\n\n\n%(commit)\nThe currently selected commit ID.\n\n\n%(blob)\nThe currently selected blob ID.\n\n\n%(branch)\nThe currently selected branch name.\n\n\n%(remote)\nThe currently selected remote name. For remote\n\t\t\t branches %(branch) will contain the branch name.\n\n\n%(tag)\nThe currently selected tag name.\n\n\n%(refname)\nThe currently selected reference name including the\n\t\t\t remote name for remote branches.\n\n\n%(stash)\nThe currently selected stash name.\n\n\n%(directory)\nThe current directory path in the tree view or\n\t\t\t \".\" if undefined.\n\n\n%(file)\nThe currently selected file.\n\n\n%(lineno)\nThe currently selected line number. Defaults to 0.\n\n\n%(lineno_old)\nThe currently selected line number, before the diff\n\t\t\t was applied. Defaults to 0.\n\n\n%(ref)\nThe reference given to blame or HEAD if undefined.\n\n\n%(revargs)\nThe revision arguments passed on the command line.\n\n\n%(fileargs)\nThe file arguments passed on the command line.\n\n\n%(cmdlineargs)\nAll other options passed on the command line.\n\n\n%(diffargs)\nOptions from diff-options or TIG_DIFF_OPTS used\n\t\t\t by the diff and stage view.\n\n\n%(blameargs)\nOptions from blame-options used by the blame view.\n\n\n%(logargs)\nOptions from log-options used by the log view.\n\n\n%(mainargs)\nOptions from main-options used by the main view.\n\n\n%(prompt)\nPrompt for the argument value. Optionally specify a\n\t\t\t custom prompt using \"%(prompt Enter branch name: )\"\n\n\n%(text)\nThe text of the currently selected line.\n\n\n%(repo:head)\nThe name of the checked out branch, e.g. master\n\n\n%(repo:head-id)\nThe commit ID of the checked out branch.\n\n\n%(repo:remote)\nThe remote associated with the checked out branch,\n\t\t\t e.g. origin/master.\n\n\n%(repo:cdup)\nThe path to change directory to the repository root,\n\t\t\t e.g. ../\n\n\n%(repo:prefix)\nThe path prefix of the current work directory,\n\t\t\t e.g subdir/.\n\n\n%(repo:git-dir)\nThe path to the Git directory, e.g. /src/repo/.git.\n\n\n%(repo:worktree)\nThe worktree path, if defined.\n\n\n%(repo:is-inside-work-tree)\nWhether Tig is running inside a work tree,\n\t\t\t either true or false.\n\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n# Save the current commit as a patch file when the user selects a commit\n# in the main view and presses 'S'.\nbind main S !git format-patch -1 %(commit)\n\n# Create and checkout a new branch; specify custom prompt\nbind main B ?git checkout -b \"%(prompt Enter new branch name: )\"\n\n# Show commit statistics for the author under the cursor\nbind main U +sh -c 'git --no-pager shortlog -s --author=\"$(git show -s --format=%aE %(commit))\" \n\n\n\n\nAdvanced shell-like commands\n\nIf your command requires use of dynamic features, such as subshells,\nexpansion of environment variables and process control, this can be achieved by\nusing a shell command:\n\n\nConfigure a binding to copy the current commit ID to the clipboard.\n\nbind generic I @sh -c \"echo -n %(commit) | xclip -selection c\"\n\n\n\nOr by using a combination of Git aliases and Tig external commands. The\nfollowing example entries can be put in either the .gitconfig or .git/config\nfile:\n\n\nGit configuration which binds Tig keys to Git command aliases.\n\n[alias]\n\tgitk-bg = !\"gitk HEAD --not $(git rev-parse --remotes) &\"\n\tpublish = !\"for i in origin public; do git push $i; done\"\n[tig \"bind\"]\n\tgeneric = V @git gitk-bg\n\tgeneric = > !git publish\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal user-defined commands\n\nActions beginning with a : will be run and interpreted as internal commands\nand act similar to commands run via Tig’s prompt. Valid internal commands are\nconfiguration file options (as described in this document) and pager view\ncommands.

If your\nterminal supports color, these commands can be used to assign foreground and\nbackground combinations to certain areas. Optionally, an attribute can be\ngiven as the last parameter. The syntax is:\n\n\ncolor area fgcolor bgcolor [attributes]\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n# Override the default terminal colors to white on black.\ncolor default\t\twhite\tblack\n# Diff colors\ncolor diff-header\tyellow\tdefault\ncolor diff-index\tblue\tdefault\ncolor diff-chunk\tmagenta\tdefault\ncolor \"Reported-by:\"\tgreen\tdefault\n# View-specific color\ncolor tree.date\t\tblack\tcyan\tbold\n\n\n\nOr in the Git configuration files:\n\n\n\n[tig \"color\"]\n\t# A strange looking cursor line\n\tcursor\t\t= red\tdefault underline\n\t# UI colors\n\ttitle-blur\t= white\tblue\n\ttitle-focus\t= white\tblue\tbold\n# View-specific color\n[tig \"color.tree\"]\n\tdate\t\t= cyan\tdefault\tbold\n\n\n\n\nArea names\n\nCan be either a built-in area name or a custom quoted string. The\nlatter allows custom color rules to be added for lines matching a\nquoted string.\nValid built-in area names are described below. Note, all names are\ncase-insensitive, and you may use -, and _ interchangeably,\ne.g. \"Diff-Header\" and \"DIFF_HEADER\" are the same.\nView-specific colors can be defined by prefixing the view name to\nthe area name, e.g. \"stage.diff-chunk\" and \"diff.diff-chunk\".\n\nColor names\n\nValid colors include: white, black, green, magenta, blue,\ncyan, yellow, red, default. Use default to refer to the\ndefault terminal colors, for example, to keep the background\ntransparent when you are using a terminal with a transparent\nbackground.\n\nColors can also be specified using the keywords color0, color1, …​,\ncolorN-1 (where N is the number of colors supported by your terminal).\nThis is useful when you remap the colors for your display or want to enable\ncolors supported by 88-color and 256-color terminals. Note that the color\nprefix is optional. If you prefer, you can specify colors directly by their\nnumbers 0, 1, …​, N-1 instead, just like in the configuration file of\nGit.\n\n\nAttribute names\n\nValid attributes include: normal, blink, bold, dim, reverse,\nstandout, and underline. Note, not all attributes may be supported\nby the terminal.\n\n\n\n\nUI colors\n\nThe colors and attributes to be used for the text that is not highlighted or\nthat specify the use of the default terminal colors can be controlled by\nsetting the default color option.\n\n\nTable 1.

When used as a pager, it will\ndisplay input from stdin and colorize it.\n\n\nWhen browsing repositories, Tig uses the underlying Git commands to present\nthe user with various views, such as summarized commit log and showing the\ncommit with the log message, diffstat, and the diff.\n\n\n\n\nCalling Conventions\n\n\nPager Mode\n\nIf stdin is a pipe, any log or diff options will be ignored and the pager view\nwill be opened loading data from stdin. The pager mode can be used for\ncolorizing output from various Git commands.\n\n\nExample on how to colorize the output of git-show(1):\n\n\n\n$ git show | tig\n\n\n\n\nGit Command Options\n\nAll Git command options specified on the command line will be passed to the\ngiven command and all will be shell quoted before they are passed to the\nshell.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you specify options for the main view, you should not use the\n--pretty option as this option will be set automatically to the format\nexpected by the main view.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample on how to view a commit and show both author and committer\ninformation:\n\n\n\n$ tig show --pretty=fuller\n\n\n\nSee the section on specifying revisions for an introduction to\nrevision options supported by the Git commands. For details on specific Git\ncommand options, refer to the man page of the command in question.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Viewer\n\n\nThe display consists of a status window on the last line of the screen and one\nor more views. The default is to only show one view at a time but it is\npossible to split both the main and log view to also show the commit diff.\n\n\nIf you are in the log view and press Enter when the current line is a commit\nline, such as:\n\n\n\ncommit 4d55caff4cc89335192f3e566004b4ceef572521\n\n\n\nYou will split the view so that the log view is displayed in the top window\nand the diff view in the bottom window. You can switch between the two views\nby pressing Tab. To maximize the log view again, simply press l.\n\n\nViews\n\nVarious views of a repository are presented. Each view is based on output\nfrom an external command, most often git log, git diff, or git show.\n\n\n\nThe main view\n\nIs the default view, and it shows a one line summary of each commit\nin the chosen list of revisions. The summary includes author date,\nauthor, and the first line of the log message. Additionally, any\nrepository references, such as tags, will be shown.\n\nThe log view\n\nPresents a more rich view of the revision log showing the whole log\nmessage and the diffstat.\n\nThe reflog view\n\nPresents a view of the reflog allowing to navigate the repo\nhistory.\n\nThe diff view\n\nShows either the diff of the current working tree, that is, what\nhas changed since the last commit, or the commit diff complete\nwith log message, diffstat and diff.\n\nThe tree view\n\nLists directory trees associated with the current revision allowing\nsubdirectories to be descended or ascended and file blobs to be\nviewed.\n\nThe blob view\n\nDisplays the file content or \"blob\" of data associated with a file\nname.\n\nThe blame view\n\nDisplays the file content annotated or blamed by commits.\n\nThe refs view\n\nDisplays the branches, remotes and tags in the repository.\n\nThe status view\n\nDisplays status of files in the working tree and allows changes to be\nstaged/unstaged as well as adding of untracked files.\n\nThe stage view\n\nDisplays diff changes for staged or unstaged files being tracked or\nfile content of untracked files.\n\nThe stash view\n\nDisplays the list of stashes in the repository.\n\nThe grep view\n\nDisplays a list of files and all the lines that matches a search\npattern.\n\nThe pager view\n\nIs used for displaying both input from stdin and output from Git\ncommands entered in the internal prompt.\n\nThe help view\n\nDisplays a quick reference of key bindings.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowsing State and User-defined Commands\n\nThe viewer keeps track of both what head and commit ID you are currently\nviewing. The commit ID will follow the cursor line and change every time you\nhighlight a different commit. Whenever you reopen the diff view it will be\nreloaded, if the commit ID changed. The head ID is used when opening the main\nand log view to indicate from what revision to show history.\n\n\nSome of the commands used or provided by Tig can be configured. This goes for\nsome of the environment variables as well as the\nexternal commands. These user-defined commands can use\narguments that refer to the current browsing state by using one of the\nfollowing variables.\n\n\nTable 1. Browsing state variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%(head)\nThe currently viewed head ID. Defaults to HEAD\n\n\n%(commit)\nThe currently selected commit ID.\n\n\n%(blob)\nThe currently selected blob ID.\n\n\n%(branch)\nThe currently selected branch name.\n\n\n%(remote)\nThe currently selected remote name.

They are bound to keys and use information from the\ncurrent browsing state, such as the current commit ID. Tig comes with\nthe following built-in external commands:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeymap\nKey\nAction\n\n\n\n\nmain\nC\ngit cherry-pick %(commit)\n\n\nstatus\nC\ngit commit\n\n\ngeneric\nG\ngit gc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevision Specification\n\n\nThis section describes various ways to specify what revisions to display or\notherwise limit the view to. Tig does not itself parse the described\nrevision options so refer to the relevant Git man pages for further\ninformation. Relevant man pages besides git-log(1) are git-diff(1) and\ngit-rev-list(1).\n\n\nYou can tune the interaction with Git by making use of the options explained\nin this section. For example, by configuring the environment variable\ndescribed in the section on diff options.\n\n\nLimit by Path Name\n\nIf you are interested only in those revisions that made changes to a specific\nfile (or even several files) list the files like this:\n\n\n\n$ tig Makefile README\n\n\n\nTo avoid ambiguity with Tig’s subcommands or repository references such as tag\nnames, be sure to separate file names from other Git options using \"--\". So\nif you have a file named status it will clash with the status subcommand,\nand thus you will have to use:\n\n\n\n$ tig -- status\n\n\n\n\nLimit by Date or Number\n\nTo speed up interaction with Git, you can limit the amount of commits to show\nboth for the log and main view. Either limit by date using e.g.\n--since=1.month or limit by the number of commits using -n400.\n\n\nIf you are only interested in changes that happened between two dates you can\nuse:\n\n\n\n$ tig --after=\"May 5th\" --before=\"2006-05-16 15:44\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you want to avoid having to quote dates containing spaces you can use\n\".\" instead, e.g. --after=May.5th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimiting by Commit Ranges\n\nAlternatively, commits can be limited to a specific range, such as \"all\ncommits between tag-1.0 and tag-2.0\". For example:\n\n\n\n$ tig tag-1.0..tag-2.0\n\n\n\nThis way of commit limiting makes it trivial to only browse the commits which\nhaven’t been pushed to a remote branch. Assuming origin is your upstream\nremote branch, using:\n\n\n\n$ tig origin..HEAD\n\n\n\nwill list what will be pushed to the remote branch. Optionally, the ending\nHEAD can be left out since it is implied.\n\n\n\nLimiting by Reachability\n\nGit interprets the range specifier \"tag-1.0..tag-2.0\" as \"all commits\nreachable from tag-2.0 but not from tag-1.0\".  Where reachability refers\nto what commits are ancestors (or part of the history) of the branch or tagged\nrevision in question.\n\n\nIf you prefer to specify which commit to preview in this way use the\nfollowing:\n\n\n\n$ tig tag-2.0 ^tag-1.0\n\n\n\nYou can think of ^ as a negation operator. Using this alternate syntax, it\nis possible to further prune commits by specifying multiple branch cut offs.\n\n\n\nCombining Revisions Specification\n\nRevision options can to some degree be combined, which makes it possible to\nsay \"show at most 20 commits from within the last month that changed files\nunder the Documentation/ directory.\"\n\n\n\n$ tig --since=1.month -n20 -- Documentation/\n\n\n\n\nExamining All Repository References\n\nIn some cases, it can be useful to query changes across all references in a\nrepository. An example is to ask \"did any line of development in this\nrepository change a particular file within the last week\". This can be\naccomplished using:\n\n\n\n$ tig --all --since=1.week -- Makefile\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nPlease visit Tig’s home page or\nmain Git repository for information about\nnew releases and how to report bugs and feature requests.\n\n\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2006-2014 Jonas Fonseca jonas.fonseca@gmail.com>\n\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\nManpages:\n\n\n\n\ntig(1)\n\n\ntigrc(5)\n\n\n\n\n"},"test/":{"url":"test/","title":"Testing","keywords":"","body":"Test Overview\n\n\n\nAll tests can be run with make test. This will run all scripts that\nend with -test in the test folder and summarize the test results\nusing the script test/tools/show-results.sh.\n\n\nTo run individual tests, use make  e.g. make\ntest/tigrc/parse-test. Alternatively, tests can be run directly via the\ntest scripts as long as PATH is set to include the directories src/\nand test/tools. The latter directory is where the test helper\nlibraries are located, the most important of which is libtest.sh.\n\n\nThe test suite requires stty -tostop to be set in the running terminal,\nwhich is typically the default.\n\n\n\n\nOptions\n\n\nTests can be configured by setting the TEST_OPTS environment variable.\nThe variable should contain a space-separated list of options. The\nfollowing options are supported:\n\n\n\nverbose\n\nWhether to print individual test results even when all\nassertions passed. The default is to not show results for passed\ntests.\n\nno-indent\n\nDo not indent test output. This is automatically set depending\non whether V=1 was passed to make to show verbose output.\n\ndebugger[=\n\nInvoke tig via a debugger, for example debugger=lldb. When no\nprogram is specified it is auto-detected. Remember to recompile\nusing make clean all-debug to expose all symbols.\n\nfilter=:\n\nOnly run test files or cases matching a shell-style glob filter. A\ncolon separates the file glob from the case glob.  No colon, or\ntrailing colon, is equivalent to trailing :* (all cases). Leading\ncolon is equivalent to leading *: (all files).  The file portion\nis matched against a path fragment from the project root.\nExample:\n\n\n\n\n\n\t$ TEST_OPTS='filter=*:*default' make test/tigrc/width-test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis option is a convenience for development against specific tests.\nTest files and test cases are filtered, but not assertions.  Thus some\nassertions are expected to fail in the presence of a filter.  Testing\noutput originating from make is also not filtered.\n\ntrace\n\nShow trace information.\n\ntodos\n\nRun TODO tests, which are otherwise skipped.\n\nvalgrind\n\nRun tests and verify memory access with Valgrind.\n\ntimeout=\n\nSet the default timeout for each invocation of tig under the\ntest harness. The default is 10 if unset. 0 means \"no\ntimeout\". Individual tests may override the value.\n\n\n\n\n"}}}
